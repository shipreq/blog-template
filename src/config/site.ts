    A blog detailing technical learnings and experiences during work on ShipReq.
    Common themes are FP (functional programming) with Scala, Scala.JS, @japgolly libraries
    like scalajs-react, scalacss, scala-graal, and other related technologies.
    Coding with high quality is an important ShipReq value and so you can also expect articles
    about advanced type-safety, testing, performance/benchmarking.
    ShipReq is a modern, online tool for software requirements development and management.

      Hi! I'm the founder/creator of ShipReq.
      I've been coding since I was a kid, and
      have been euphorically doing full-stack functional programming in Scala for ${Year - 2012} years and counting.
      I love to create that which sparks joy in others.
